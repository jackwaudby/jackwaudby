### Jack Waudby

I'm a software engineer at [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) working in the Clustering team. 
I'm also a PhD student at [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk) where I'm part of the [Scalable Computing Group](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/research/groups/scalable/#about) and the [Cloud Computing for Big Data Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/bigdata/). 

My research interests are:
+ Transaction management 
+ Data replication
+ Graph processing
+ Benchmarking

I also host [Disseminate: The Computer Science Research Podcast](https://disseminatepodcast.podcastpage.io/) which features interviews with Computer Science researchers about their latest work in attempt to help further narrow the gap between research and practice, and to generally make awesome research more accessible.
